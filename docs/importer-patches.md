# CSLib importer patches — 2026-09-08

These are the known compatibility fixes for checking CSLib and its Lean/Std/
Mathlib dependencies. **A complete CSLib check has not finished, so this is not
a proven minimal or sufficient patch set.** Kernel conversion performance is
a separate workstream.

## Compatibility fixes to retain

All `submit/*` names below are branches of
[theostos/rocq-lean-import](https://github.com/theostos/rocq-lean-import).
Copy-ready titles, bodies and recorded error excerpts are in
[PR_BODIES.md](https://github.com/theostos/rocq-lean-import/blob/docs/cslib-patches/PR_BODIES.md).
Review bases are listed in
[REVIEWING.md](https://github.com/theostos/rocq-lean-import/blob/docs/cslib-patches/REVIEWING.md).

| Fix | Current branch | Concrete problem / validation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependent projections | `submit/dependent-projections` | Substitute preceding fields into dependent field types and compute case relevance in the correct context. The `DepRec.proof` and `Subtype.val` imports fail before the fix and pass after it. |
| Mutual inductives | `submit/mutual-inductives` | Declare and instantiate the whole mutual block, including its recursors and Prop/SProp instances. Tested with `Tree`/`Forest` and polymorphic mutual blocks. |
| Constructor ownership | `submit/constructor-owners` | Instantiate an inductive before resolving its constructor. Motivating failure: missing `Lean.JsonRpc.ResponseError.mk` in `Lean.Server.Watchdog.eraseFileWorker`; focused `constructor_owner` fixture passes. |
| Nested recursors | `submit/nested-recursors` | Translate main and auxiliary recursors through supported containers/records; derive their relevance correctly. Motivating failure: `Lean.Meta.DiscrTree.Trie.casesOn`. Container, mutual, dependent-record and reload fixtures pass. |
| Modern UInt32/Char | external [PR #72](https://github.com/rocq-community/rocq-lean-import/pull/72), then `submit/uint32-constructor` | Use the BitVec representation and the exported constructor name `UInt32.ofBitVec`. The external PR is mirrored locally by `integration/upstream-pr72`; our correction is a separate delta. |
| Modern string literals | `submit/string-of-list` | Use `String.ofList` when `String.mk` is not yet available in the import. The fixture checks function selection and application; it does not check Lean's entire byte-array string implementation. |
| Unit elimination | `submit/unit-like-eliminators` | Lean reduces a match on a neutral `Unit`; stock Rocq leaves it stuck. The importer registers eligible types and builds checked eliminators. This needs the experimental **kernel unit-conversion rule for correctness**, independently of delta-unfolding performance. Motivating cases: `Unit.sizeOf` and the CSLib FinLoop totality proof. |

Hex parsing ([#68](https://github.com/rocq-community/rocq-lean-import/pull/68))
and name escaping ([#69](https://github.com/rocq-community/rocq-lean-import/pull/69))
are already in upstream `c8db093`; no separate branches are needed.

## #70 and the next PR

[#70](https://github.com/rocq-community/rocq-lean-import/pull/70) stays open as
requested. Its demonstrated effect is a smaller exposed Rocq universe instance.
The Lean fixture already imports before it. The historical `Int64.toInt_minValue`
constraint error was fixed by `4de13e2` in the retired proof-reconstruction path;
that path is absent from upstream. Neither that commit nor #70 is established
as a required CSLib compatibility fix.

A later [controlled CSLib comparison](pr70-cslib-comparison.md) now tests the
current stack with its universe changes removed. Both versions reach the same
line-697462 kernel timeout and pass the selected original CSLib/dependency
proofs, including FreeM and DiscrTree. No regression was found in that coverage.

`submit/universe-instances` is now separate from every other submission topic
and both review integrations. It corresponds to existing #70, **not another
PR to submit**.

The next independent PR is
[`submit/dependent-projections`](https://github.com/theostos/rocq-lean-import/tree/submit/dependent-projections)
at `953bccc`, directly on upstream `c8db093`, without #70. Both failing imports
above were reproduced on upstream and pass with this patch. The candidate
name remains an alias. Descendant topics and integrations have been restacked
without #70; their fresh runtime gate is still pending. The nested topic retains
its own lower-bound bookkeeping, not #70's complete instance recipes or
source-parameter pruning.

`submit/constructor-owners` and `submit/nested-recursors` both start from
`submit/mutual-inductives`: they are sibling topics, not consecutive PRs.

## Other useful work, kept separately

| Branches | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `submit/strict-import-errors` | Reliable failure/partial-import reporting and declaration timeouts. Useful for establishing a real full-library pass; not a Lean typing fix. |
| `submit/reducibility-hints` | Preserve exported reduction metadata and genuine opacity; requires the matching exporter. Supports conversion strategy. |
| `submit/primitive-record-eliminators` | Faster elimination using Rocq's existing record eta, with conversion checks. |
| `submit/parser-sharing`, `submit/indexed-checkpoints`, `submit/translation-sharing` | Reduce memory and repeated traversal; save/reload large prefixes. |
| `submit/compact-arithmetic` | Connect the importer to experimental compact-Nat arithmetic. Needed by the current accelerated setup; not an independent stock-Rocq compatibility fix. |

The unit topic is currently stacked on compact arithmetic. This is its review
branch dependency, not a claim that unit conversion is merely an optimization.
`integration/importer-review-stock` and
`integration/importer-review-experimental` assemble the topics without #70.

## Evidence and cleanup

The earlier recorded gates cover 12 stock-runtime topics, three experimental
topics, and their integrations. The subsequent cleanup simplified source and
removed branch-local review notes. The restack also removed #70's implementation
and dedicated fixture from other topics. Syntax/history checks pass; the new
runtime gate was refused because the full cslib run owned the shared worker.
Earlier integration results are not fresh validation of these rewritten tips.
The previous experimental integration passed 49 Rocq fixtures, parser tests and
strict-error assertions.
Its complete **81,106-line core fixture is not the full CSLib export**.
See the [review guide](https://github.com/theostos/rocq-lean-import/blob/docs/cslib-patches/REVIEWING.md)
and [validation manifest](https://github.com/theostos/rocq-lean-import/blob/docs/cslib-patches/validation.json)
for dependencies, runtimes and limitations.

The cleanup retains the current `submit/*` topics, the independent projection
candidate, integration bases, #70, and this documentation branch. Historical
`pr/*`, `feature/*`, `prototype/*`, `review/*`, diagnostics, merged topics and
duplicate fix branches are archived before their branch references are removed.
Two local exceptions remain: `arena-fixes` has an unresolved merge, and
`integration/generic-cslib-current` is referenced by the runtime configuration.

Archive tags use `archive/2026-09-08/fork/<old-branch>` for removed fork heads
and `archive/2026-09-08/local/<old-branch>` for removed local heads. Only fork
archives are published. Existing checkouts, uncommitted edits, binaries and
checkpoints are preserved. Restore a fork branch, for example, with:

```sh
git fetch fork --tags
git switch -c recovered/nested-containers archive/2026-09-08/fork/pr/nested-containers
```

A full Git bundle, the ref inventory, dirty-worktree snapshots, cleanup plan
and verification results are saved in the arena at
`work/importer-cleanup-20260908/`.
